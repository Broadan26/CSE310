Project Repository for the ASU class Data Structures and Algorithms

### Project 1

Implement merge sort and insertion sort to encode and decode text files using stdin/stdout to redirect input and output.

### Project 2

Use multiple different data structures to query Storm event data. Data structures include a Hash Table, Binary Search Tree, and a Max Heap.

### Project 3

Read in binary data to construct models about sea ice concentration and utilize Floyd-Warshall, Clustering Coefficients, a histogram and other statistical methods to analyze the data.
